We used Jest for some rudimentary testing, but with time constraints and encroaching deadlines the front-end testing was limited as we needed to focus on other aspects of the application.

We tested publications, categories, and latest news to ensure our news API and application were functioning as intended.
Two of these tests actually were successful in the terminal with the only failing one being the latest news test.
Testing files weren't included in the application file structure as they were causing the application to crash.
